# Background and Requirements

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:Â https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

# Running Procedure
1. R console / R Studio is available
2. full access to home directory set in R console or R Studio
3. load plotX.R and in console run plotX() (where X stands for 1..4)
